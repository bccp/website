|Adrian Liu, BCCP Postdoctoral Fellow|\ Although I am broadly interested
in astrophysics and cosmology, my recent work has focused on using the
21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen atoms to map our Universe.
This technique, known as 21cm tomography, will eventually survey the
distribution of matter in a larger faction of our observable Universe
than current cosmological probes such as galaxy surveys and the cosmic
microwave background. In addition to providing better constraints on
cosmological parameters, this will allow precision tests of inflation
and competitive bounds on the neutrino mass. Crucially, 21cm tomography
will also be the only direct observational probe the Epoch of
Reionization (EoR), during which the first stars and galaxies formed.
Understanding how these first structures formed will help to complete
the story of our Universe's transformation from a set of primordial
fluctuations to the rich collection of astronomical structures that we
see today. Unfortunately, 21cm tomography is technically challenging and
has yet to mature into a practical probe of cosmology. My recent
research has thus focused on bridging the gap between the theoretical
promise and observational reality of 21cm tomography. This has led to
algorithm development for radio telescope calibration, studies of
Galactic and xtragalactic foreground contamination, and methods
for foreground subtraction. Experimental design and a critical
examination of observationally measurable statistics have also been
recent considerations. I am also part of a number of observational
groups, including the MWA, GMRT-EoR, and PAPER, and am involved in data
analysis efforts. Early attempts at detecting a genuine cosmological
signal from the data have been encouraging, if challenging, and suggest
that 21cm tomography will soon be able to live up to its great
potential.
