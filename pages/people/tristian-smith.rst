Interview

My research lies at the interface between cosmology and gravity. Gravity
has always occupied a unique place among the fundamental forces of
nature: as the ‘universal force’ it plays an essential role in the
evolution of the Universe, from the big bang to today; as the only known
force that cannot be written within a consistent quantum theory its
underlying nature is expected to help elucidate the complete ‘theory of
everything’; as the weakest force it allows information to come to us to
from events occurring at energy scales approaching the Planck scale. My
research concentrates on using novel probes in order to address
questions concerning the dynamics of inflation, the nature of dark
energy, observational signatures of string-inspired modifications to
general relativity, and the fundamental symmetries of gravity (such as
parity and Lorentz invariance). Primordial gravitational-wave
backgrounds provide an unparalleled window into physical processes
occurring at energy scales as high as the Planck scale. In particular,
the gravitational-wave background might allow us to infer fundamental
properties of the processes that produce such backgrounds, such as
inflation. To this end, along with Marc Kamionkowski and Asantha Cooray,
I have studied how the direct detection of the inflationary
gravitational-wave background (IGWB) would enable a probe of the
fundamental nature of the inflationary epoch. Our work has shown how
direct observations of the IGWB will allow us an unprecedented view into
the mechanisms behind inflation and that there is a good chance the IGWB
will be observable in BBO. However it is possible that a non-standard
expansion history could complicate interpretations of the physical
significance of the amplitude and slope of the directly observed IGWB.
In future research I plan to address these issues and quantify how well
we may be able to remove degeneracies with a non-standard expansion
history. In addition to this, along with George Smoot and his student
Noel Swanson, I have begun a study in order to explore how well we may
use pulsar timing arrays in order to detect and measure the properties
of gravitational waves. Currently, pulsar timing arrays are the most
sensitive probe of gravitational waves and their sensitivity is expected
to increase by several orders of magnitude with the construction of the
Square Kilometer Array (SKA) radio telescope which plans to be in full
operation by 2020. Many groups have explored how to use pulsar timing
measurements in order to place limits on stochastic gravitational wave
backgrounds. However, less work has focused on identifying how to use
this data to explore other sources of gravitational waves such as short
duration bursts and polarized backgrounds. We plan to articulate how
best to use this data in order to extract as much information about
gravitational waves as possible. The study of alternative theories to
general relativity has recently gained a lot of interest because of the
observation that the expansion of the Universe is accelerating. Many
explanations for the accelerated expansion rely on proposing a new
source of stress-energy within the context of general relativity (such
as a cosmological constant or a scalar field). Alternatively, the
observed accelerated expansion might indicate a breakdown of general
relativity. Along with Adrienne Erickcek, Marc Kamionkowski, and Takeshi
Chiba, I have shown that certain gravity theories [known as
f(R)-gravity] that have the potential to explain the current epoch of
accelerated expansion, under a particular set of conditions, severely
violate observations of gravity within the solar system. Our work has
made it clear that it is the non-linear behavior of the theory as well
as its behavior on cosmological scales that allows it to pass solar
system tests. This non-linear behavior gives f(R) gravity some unique
observational consequences. In particular, measurements comparing the
bending of light around an object and the object’s mass yields a
determination of a parameter denoted gamma\_PPN. In general relativity
gamma\_PPN = 1. However, in f(R) gravity the value of gamma\_PPN depends
on the strength of the gravitational field around that object. Current
lensing surveys, such as the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey, provide us
with observations that may allow us to test whether γPPN assumes a
universal value or not thereby testing such alternative gravity theories
as f(R) gravity. In ongoing work, I explore how well such surveys can
test the universality of the value of gamma\_PPN . Besides providing an
explanation for the recent epoch of accelerated expansion, modifications
to the Einstein-Hilbert action are expected since quantized general
relativity is non- renormalizable. One common feature of these
modifications is to introduce parity violation into the gravitational
sector. In work done in collaboration with Adrienne Erickcek, Robert
Caldwell, and Marc Kamionkowski, I have looked at how we may detect
parity violation by probing the gravitomagnetic field applicable to the
rotating Earth. Two current experiments seek to measure this field:
LAGEOS has measured it to within 10% of its general relativistic value
and Gravity Probe B will attempt to measure it to at least this
accuracy. In related work I have investigated how the post-Newtonian
equations of motion depend on an unspecified gravitomagnetic field.
Using the fact that any alternative gravitational Ampere’s law must
respect mass conservation I have been able to derive a general form that
the gravitomagnetic field can take. Using these results I have found the
expressions for the secular changes in the inclination, argument of
pericenter, and line of nodes applicable to binary systems for a
generalized gravitomagnetic field. This framework allows for a more
complete analysis of gravitomagnetic effects in these systems,
especially the recently discovered double pulsar system, PSR J0737-3039A
