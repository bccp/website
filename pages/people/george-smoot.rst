|image0|\ George Smoot was co-awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics
"for discovery of the blackbody form and anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation.” Smoot received Bachelor degrees (1966)
in Mathematics and Physics and a Ph.D. (1970) in Physics from MIT. Smoot
has been at the University of California Berkeley and the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory since 1970. In April 1992, George Smoot
made the announcement that the team he led had detected the long sought
variations in the early Universe that had been observed by the COBE DMR.
NASA's COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) satellite mapped the intensity
of the radiation from the early Big Bang and found variations so small
they had to be the seeds on which gravity worked to grow the galaxies,
clusters of galaxies, and clusters of clusters that are observed in the
universe today. These variations are also relics of creation. Professor
Smoot is an author of more than 200 science papers and is also co-author
(with Keay Davidson) of the popularized scientific book Wrinkles in Time
(Harper, 1994) that elucidates cosmology and the COBE discovery. Another
essay entitled “My Einstein Suspenders” appears in My Einstein: Essays
by Twenty-four of the World's Leading Thinkers on the Man, His Work, and
His Legacy (Ed. John Brockman, Pantheon, 2006). Currently, Professor
Smoot conducts research in astrophysics and observational cosmology, and
is most famous for his research on the cosmic background radiation. This
radiation is thought to be the relic of the intense heat of the early
Big Bang. Smoot continues research in cosmology and is currently
involved in the Planck and SNAP missions. The Planck mission is the
third generation mission to exploit the CMB fluctuations discovered by
COBE DMR. SNAP is a mission to understand the Dark Energy causing the
current expansion of the Universe to accelerate. |image1| Dr. Smoot,
