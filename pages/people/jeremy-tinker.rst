I am a theoretical astrophysicist specializing in the large-scale structure of
the universe and models of galaxy bias. I use measurements of galaxy
clustering from surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Two-Degree
Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, and Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe
to connect the distribution of galaxies to the dark matter that lies
underneath. Galaxy bias can either be thought of as a nuisance parameter
to navigate when trying to constrain cosmological parameters from
clustering measurements, or it can be used as a tool to gain insight on
the formation of evolution of galaxies themselves. 

My research attempts
to meet both goals. I was a graduate student at Ohio State University
(2000-2005), where I worked with David Weinberg on developing a
theoretical framework for using upcoming galaxy clustering measurements
to constrain cosmology. After finishing at Ohio State, I moved on to the
Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago,
where I worked with Andrey Kravtsov. 

At Chicago I extended my research
into numerical simulations of cosmic structure and the properties of
dark matter halos realized in such simulations. I am currently
developing a model for quasar absorption lines, such as MgII or
Lyman-limit systems, that encompasses such objects into our framework of
large scale structure. This will put both condensed baryonic objects
(ie, galaxies) and extended gaseous halos (ie, the material from which
galaxies form) within the same theoretical model, providing insight into
the formation mechanisms of galactic structure.
