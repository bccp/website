   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology">Cosmology</a> is the study of the universe as a whole since its
   inception. 
   </p>
   <p>
   Here at Berkeley Center For Cosmological Physics (BCCP) 
   we focus on understanding the origin and evolution of
   the universe through a series of programs to define the observations,
   experiments, concepts, and simulations needed to answer the fundamental
   questions in cosmology. 
   </p>
   <p>
   Combining experimentation, computation, and
   theory, BCCP continues to develop the foundation of an accurate,
   reliable model of the cosmos. </p>
   <p>Furthermore, we compare the implications of this
   evolving model against observations — thus opening new horizons and
   expanding our knowledge of the universe.
