Week of November 24
===================

**Tuesday, November 25** Location: UCB, Hearst Field Annex B-1 – 1:10 pm
Speaker: Camille Avestruz, Yale Title: "Cosmological Simulations of
Galaxy Cluster Outskirts" Abstract: The observational study of galaxy
cluster outskirts is a new territory to probe the thermodynamic and
chemical structure of the X-ray emitting intracluster medium (ICM).
Cluster outskirts are particularly important for modeling the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, which is sensitive to hot electrons at all
radii and has been used to detect hundreds of galaxy clusters with
recent microwave cluster surveys. In cluster-based cosmology,
measurements of cluster outskirts are an important avenue for estimating
the cluster mass, as the outskirts are less sensitive to baryonic
processes that dominate the cluster core. However, recent observations
of cluster outskirts deviate from theoretical expectations, indicating
that cluster outskirts are more complicated than previously thought.
Computational modeling of cluster outskirts is necessary to interpret
these observations. I will present cosmological simulations of galaxy
cluster formation that follow the thermodynamic and chemical structures
in the virialization regions of the ICM and transition to the IGM.
Specifically, I will discuss how observational signatures of galaxy
clusters are affected by gas flows, inhomogeneities in the ICM, and
non-equilibrium physics.

Title: "Massive neutrinos and the Large Scale Structures of the
Universe" Abstract: Massive neutrinos have peculiar effects on several
observables in current and future redshift surveys. A precise
determination of them is crucial not only to constraint properly
neutrino masses but also to avoid potential systematic errors in the
determination of other cosmological parameters, e.g. the dark energy
equation of state. In this talk, after a brief review of linear theory
results, I will discuss, with the help of a large suite of N-body
simulations, the effect of massive neutrinos on different cosmological
probes, like the abundance of massive clusters, the non linear matter
power spectrum and its relation to the galaxy power spectrum, redshift
space distorsions, and the
bispectrum. <http://www-theory.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/talks/plans.cgi>`__

LBNL - 50A-5132, 4:00 p.m. Speaker: Gianpaolo Carosi (LLNL) Title: "The
ADMX Experiment“ Abstract: The nature of dark matter is one of the great
mysteries of modern physics. Existence of dark matter has been inferred
from its gravitational effects over many distance scales, but currently
no known particle can account for the observed data. As a result, new
particles beyond the standard model have been suggested. The axion is
one such particle that was originally devised as a solution to the
strong-CP problem in nuclear physics (or the peculiar absence of a
measurable electric dipole moment in the neutron). The Axion Dark Matter
eXperiment (ADMX), and its sister experiment ADMX-High Frequency
(ADMX-HF), are designed to detect axions by using large microwave
cavities immersed in a strong magnetic field to resonantly convert the
axion’s rest mass into detectable photons. In this talk I will describe
the history of axion searches and the ADMX experiment in particular,
which ran at LLNL for over a decade before being moved to the University
of Washington. I will then discuss the upgrades to the ADMX experiment
as it prepares for its upcoming search with orders-of-magnitude greater
sensitivity. I will also outline R&D efforts currently being undertaken
to expand the search range of ADMX further and ultimately determine if
axions are, or are not, the major dark matter component of the Universe.

"The primordial deuterium abundance and the search for new physics"
Abstract: We are currently in an exciting era of precision cosmology.
With the release of the cosmic microwave background data recorded by the
Planck satellite, we are now in a position to accurately test the
standard model of cosmology and particle physics. In this talk, I will
present several precise measurements of the primordial abundance of
deuterium - the most accurate measurements to date - derived from
redshift ~3 metal-poor damped Lyman-alpha systems. These data have
offered a new insight into the physical laws of the Universe just
minutes after the Big Bang. Such precise measures, when analyzed in
conjunction with the Planck data, now place strong bounds on both the
total amount of visible matter in the Universe and the effective number
of neutrino species. These data further provide new limits on physics
beyond the standard model. I will discuss our ongoing survey to obtain
new precision measures of the primordial nuclei in the era of the 30m
class telescopes. `*SSL
