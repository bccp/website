Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BCCP cosmologists are world leaders in the newest approach to dark
energy measurements - Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). By studying
the clustering of nearby galaxies, we can detect the imprint of the
sound waves that were “frozen in” as the cosmic plasma of the early
universe cooled — the same acoustic phenomena that produced the
anisotropies we see in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).  By
comparing the structure in the CMB with the distribution of galaxies
in the near universe, we obtain a measurement of the properties of
dark energy causing the recent cosmic acceleration. This gives a new
window on the phenomenon, which is independent of the one using
supernovae, providing a complementary way of understanding the history
of the universe and what drives it. The Center’s scientists are
developing a new project that can make a dramatic step forward in BAO
dark energy measurements.  The survey is designed to obtain spectra of
1.5 million galaxies at z<0.7, and 160,000 quasars for the BAO signal
at much higher redshifts.

BCCP scientists are at the forefront of CMB instrumentation
developments. We have instruments running on several cutting-edge
experiments, including the `Planck satellite <http://sci.esa.int/planck>`_
and the `South Pole Telescope <http://pole.uchicago.edu/>`_, 
which is currently
collecting the best data of small angular scale anisotropies. The Planck
satellite was launched on May 14, 2009.  BCCP Director George Smoot has
been involved in the Planck mission since its inception, and is a senior
member of the project. PolarBeaR is undergoing construction and will
eventually observe from the high Atacama Desert in Chile, with even
better sensitivity although over a smaller area of sky. The ambitious
goal of this work is to search for the signature of gravity waves from
the inflationary era of the universe 10 :sup:`-35` seconds after the
Big Bang at energies of 10 :sup:`16` GeV. Such a discovery would reveal
the universe at energy scales that probe fundamental physics beyond the
reach of particle accelerators - a critical step in efforts to map the
entire history of the universe. These projects illustrate the diverse
capabilities of BCCP, including:

-  CMB experience in the `Berkeley Department of
   Physics <http://physics.berkeley.edu/>`_
-  Experience with large detector systems
-  Parallel supercomputing expertise
   at `NERSC <http://www.nersc.gov/>`_
-  Electromagnetic design expertise at `RAL <http://ral.berkeley.edu/>`_
-  The micro fabrication facilities in Berkeley’s electrical engineering program

The Legacy Supernova Calibration Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of the major programs proposed for the next decade that use
supernovae to study dark energy will require a novel supernova
calibration program. These include the dramatic example of the JDEM
satellite project supernova probe and the Nearby Supernova Factory, a
key element of JDEM that demonstrated the basic steps required. Our next
task will be to design and develop a project that will scale up this
work to reach the numbers and precision needed. The Center’s scientists
in this field (leaders of the 
`Supernova Cosmology Project <http://supernova.lbl.gov/>`_, 
`JDEM <http://jdem.lbl.gov/>`_, and
the `Nearby Supernova Factory <http://snfactory.lbl.gov/>`_) are
beginning work on this next step. Like mapping the trajectory of a ball
(that forms a parabola when gravity is uniform and an ellipse when it is
not) documenting the brightness of supernova in the universe to map the
history of cosmic expansion will inform our understanding of time,
space, and the behavior of gravity.

Although cosmology has now matured to the point that we can make
significant progress in understanding key physics questions by
constructing high-precision experiments, designing and executing such
experiments requires a new level of theoretical, analytic, and
computational sophistication that is almost unprecedented in
astrophysical measurements. The exciting projects thus appear to have a
somewhat different characteristic than previous astronomy projects: the
data are complex enough that those theorists who understand the details
of the data are often needed to participate in the analysis.
Sophisticated computing capabilities are needed by both the
experimentalists and the theorists. Typically, the analysis of these
observational data now takes longer than the experiment itself!

The experimental and the theoretical — the data analysis and the
simulations — are in fact tightly interwoven in today’s cosmology. Many
of the key questions in cosmology rely on subtle signals in the data and
require theoretically sophisticated approaches to data analysis and
interpretation. Simulations are required both as event generators for
modeling the analysis pipelines and as the theoretical predictions
themselves. Numerical simulations are indispensable in investigating how
the universe evolved from the minute primordial fluctuations into the
highly nonlinear web of galaxies and clusters observed today.

EoR (Epoch of Reionization)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal of the EoR experiment is to directly detect emission from
hydrogen during the epoch of reionization — the period just after the
“dark ages” when stars were beginning to form and the modern universe is
just beginning. As the majority of baryonic matter is in the form of
hydrogen, reionization usually refers to the reionization of hydrogen
gas. There may be more than one epoch of reionization as
recent `WMAP <http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/>`_ and high redshift quasars
are beginning to reveal. Our next steps are to develop a prototype
two-element radio interferometer and testing.

Dark Energy Survey
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Dark Energy Survey <https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/>`_

The dark energy survey is an imaging survey, beginning 2012, with a new
instrument (DECam) on the 4 meter Cerro Tololo Inter-American
Observatory in Chile. It will be imaging 5000 square degrees in the
south in grizy, over 5 years, collecting information on ~300 million
galaxies up to redshift ~1. Measurements of supernovae, baryon acoustic
oscillations, galaxy clusters and weak gravitational lensing will be
used to constrain the properties of dark energy. As a wide and deep
survey, the data set will be rich enough to apply other probes of dark
energy as they are developed, or other probes of cosmology more
generally.
