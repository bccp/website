Visitor Program
---------------

We maintain an active program for visiting scholars. BCCP hosts
visitors at all levels, from senior scientists to postdocs, graduate
students, and undergraduates. If you would like to visit BCCP, please
fill out the form
`here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEVKc0pKb1ktSXFTX1hHRi13bURCLWc6MA>`_.
Longer term visits involving collaborative activities with BCCP
members are especially encouraged. BCCP can provide financial support
for longer term visitors working with BCCP members on BCCP related
projects. The applications are reviewed by a committee several times a
year. All decisions are based on the availability of space and
funding.
