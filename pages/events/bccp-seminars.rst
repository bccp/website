Speaker: Camille Avestruz, Yale Title: "Cosmological Simulations of
Galaxy Cluster Outskirts" Abstract: The observational study of galaxy
cluster outskirts is a new territory to probe the thermodynamic and
chemical structure of the X-ray emitting intracluster medium (ICM).
Cluster outskirts are particularly important for modeling the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, which is sensitive to hot electrons at all
radii and has been used to detect hundreds of galaxy clusters with
recent microwave cluster surveys. In cluster-based cosmology,
measurements of cluster outskirts are an important avenue for estimating
the cluster mass, as the outskirts are less sensitive to baryonic
processes that dominate the cluster core. However, recent observations
of cluster outskirts deviate from theoretical expectations, indicating
that cluster outskirts are more complicated than previously thought.
Computational modeling of cluster outskirts is necessary to interpret
these observations. I will present cosmological simulations of galaxy
cluster formation that follow the thermodynamic and chemical structures
in the virialization regions of the ICM and transition to the IGM.
Specifically, I will discuss how observational signatures of galaxy
clusters are affected by gas flows, inhomogeneities in the ICM, and
non-equilibrium physics.
