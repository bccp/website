Postdoctoral Fellow/Computational Data-Science Fellow positions
===============================================================

**Recruitment Period**

Open date: September 19, 2018

Next review date: December 1, 2018

Apply by this date to ensure full consideration by the committee.

Final date: December 1, 2018

Applications will continue to be accepted until this date, but those received after the review date will only be considered if the position has not yet been filled.

**Description**

The Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP) at the University of California, Berkeley, invites applications for BCCP Postdoctoral Fellows and for Computational Data-Science (CDS) Fellows, with an anticipated start date in summer or fall 2019. 

The BCCP Fellows are expected to carry out independent research on topics of their choosing in cosmology. The CDS Fellows will have their research focused at the intersection between data science and physical sciences. At least one position will be jointly with the Berkeley Foundations of data analysis institute (FODA), supported by NSF Tripods-X program (PI Seljak, Co-I Mahoney). Joint appointments may also be possible with the Berkeley institute for data science (BIDS). Both Fellows positions will be for two years with the possibility of one-year extension. 

We are especially encouraging applications in the intersection areas between physics and astronomy/astrophysics, computer science and statistics/data science. In addition to being considered for these Fellowships, applicants will also be considered for grant-supported postdoctoral positions with BCCP members. BCCP Fellows will have the opportunity to interact and work with the broad spectrum of cosmology researchers in the Berkeley Astronomy and Physics Departments, and at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The experimental and observational cosmology programs at Berkeley include supernovae, galaxy clustering (including baryonic acoustic oscillations), weak lensing and cosmic microwave background, in addition to a broad theoretical cosmology research program. The Fellows will also find a rich data-science environment at UC Berkeley and LBNL, with world-expert researchers in both computer science/statistics and domain science aspects of this emerging field. Information on the BCCP's current activities and membership may be found at the BCCP's website: bccp.berkeley.edu.

**Basic qualifications**

All Ph.D. (or equivalent) degree requirements except the dissertation at the time of application.

**Additional qualifications**

Ph.D. (or equivalent) degree by the start date.

**Preferred qualifications**

Intersection areas between cosmology, computer science, fundamental physics and astrophysics.

**Salary range**

$60,000-$70,000

**Diversity statement**

BCCP is interested in candidates who will contribute to the diversity and equal opportunity in higher education through their research.

**Family friendly statement**

UC Berkeley has an excellent benefits package as well as a number of policies and programs to support employees as they balance work and family.
