BCCP develops open-source software for use in cosmology. Here are some
of our projects:

====

`SEP`_
------

SEP is a Python and C library for source detection and photometry, adapted from the SourceExtractor code base. It makes the SourceExtractor background and detection algorithms available directly from Python and (eventually) Julia.

====

`SNCosmo`_
----------

SNCosmo is a Python package for supernova cosmology data analysis and simulation.

====

`Dierckx.jl`_
-------------

Dierckx.jl is a package for 1-d and 2-d splines in Julia. It's a wrapper of the dierckx Fortran library available from NETLIB, the same library underlying the spline classes in scipy.interpolate.

====

`cosmoxi2d`_
------------

cosmoxi2d provides theoretical predictions for the two-dimensional galaxy correlation function.  This code was used to analyze `DR9 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.426.2719R>`_, `DR10, and DR11 <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.439.3504S>`_ the SDSS-III BOSS CMASS galaxy sample and derive cosmological constraints on the geometry of the universe and the growth rate of cosmic structure.

====

`kdcount`_
----------

kdcount is a simple python extension for brute force pair-counting of point data sets. Pair-counting is the fundamental of estimating correlation functions from imaging and spectroscopy survey catalogues of quasars, galaxies, and Lyman-alpha forest.

====

`pypm`_
-------

pypm is a set of python modules for particle mesh calculation with MPI parallel python. It also provides tools to measure power spectrum, and construct Friend-of-Friend halso from n-body simulations.

- https://github.com/rainwoodman/pypm

====

`pfft-python`_
--------------

pfft-python is a thin python extension layer of the massively parallel faster fourier transformation library, PFFT. Fast Fourier Transform is the core component of Particle-Mesh based gravity solvers, which simulate the formation of large scale structure, galaxies and dark matter halos.

====

`Copter`_
---------

a C++ class library written by Jordan Carlson to compute predictions for different cosmological perturbation theory schemes.

Links:

- http://mwhite.berkeley.edu/Copter/

====

`BoxRemap`_
-----------

a new technique to remap the cubical domain of a cosmological simulation into simple non-cubical shapes.

Links:

- http://mwhite.berkeley.edu/BoxRemap/

====

`ImagingLSS`_
-------------

Code for doing large-scale structure studies with the imaging data.

Links:

- http://github.com/desihub/imaginglss/

====

`LiteMangle`_
-------------

Light-weight library for some Mangle routines.

Links:

- http://github.com/martinjameswhite/litemangle

====

`mockFactory`_
--------------

- https://github.com/mockFactory

====

`CLPT_GSRSD`_
-------------

Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (CLPT) and Gaussian Streaming Redshift-Space Distortions (GSRSD)

Links:

- https://github.com/wll745881210/CLPT_GSRSD

====

`recon_code`_
-------------

Code to perform density field reconstruction for baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) experiments
