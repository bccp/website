   **Due to difficulty to comply with the current DOE policy on Chinese government
   sponsered visiting scholars, the BCCP-Peking University Summer Studnet Visitor
   program has been discontinued.**

   **BCCP still welcome and accept motivated undergrad students of all backgrounds
   to visit for summer research internship via the regular visitor program.**

   The BCCP-Peking University Summer Student Visitor program aims to connect best
   undergraduate students of physics from Peking University with the research
   activities at the Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP). BCCP is part
   of the physics department of the University of California, Berkeley. The center
   aims to understand the origin and evolution of the universe through a series of
   programs to define the observations, experiments, concepts, and simulations
   needed to answer the fundamental questions in cosmology. [See
   http://bccp.berkeley.edu for more information]

   The visitor program hosts up to
   3 visiting students each summer (dates are flexible) on the UC Berkeley main
   campus. We also encourage longer stays, such as one semester and a summer if
   appropriate arrangements on course work can be made. Advanced researcher
   (postdoc or above) will mentor the academic research of the student after
   acceptance. Funding may be available to partially or fully cover the living and
   visa expenses, depending on the student needs and availability of funding.

   Two tracks are offered. The track assignment will be flexible according to the
   needs of the student and BCCP. Students must indicate in their application
   which track they are interested in (can be both).

   **Data Science track**

   The visitor will investigate techniques in statistics, machine learning and
   data science, and their applications to data analysis and related topics in
   physical sciences, including cosmology. The necessary mentorship on the topic
   will be provided. 

   **Cosmology track**

   The visitor will conduct a research project on theoretical models, data
   analysis or computer simulations in cosmology. 

   In both tracks the results of the project will be an internal report or a publication. In the later case the student is expected to follow through the referee process until the final publication, which may last one year after the program.

   **Qualification**

   - Currently enrolled undergraduate student; at least one academic year, and no more than two years, before planned graduation (incoming junior and incoming senior); majoring in or focusing on physics or astronomy;
   - Language: fluent in English; 
   - Excellent academic record is strongly preferred; Prior research experience and / or course project is desirable;
   - Adequate computing skills: data structures, comfortable with terminals and remote connections; data analysis with Python; some projects may require additional skills; prior HPC and GPU experience is a plus, but not required;
   - Physics: classical mechanics, thermal dynamics and modern physics; background knowledge of cosmology is beneficial, but not required.

   **Required Documents**

   - Statement: a short essay describing your prior experience and motivation (1 page at most), written in English without outside / professional help;
   - Resume and a copy of transcripts; please indicate ranking in the class;
   - Letters of reference (at least one, up to three); must be from current or previous mentors (e.g. research or project advisors);

   **Due date**

   Please send the applications before Feburary 1st, 2019

   For additional information, please contact Yu Feng [yfeng1@berkeley.edu Chinese/English] or Uros Seljak [useljak@berkeley.edu English]

   Please send applications to: yfeng1@berkeley.edu

   本项目旨在为北京大学物理系本科学生提供一个参与伯克利宇宙学中心(BCCP)的科研工作的桥梁。BCCP隶属于加州大学伯克利分校物理系，主要从事宇宙学的研究。宇宙学是一门研究宇宙的发展和起源的物理学。BCCP通过观测，实验，理论和模拟等方法探索解答宇宙学的基本问题。[http://bccp.berkeley.edu]

   此项目每年招收不超过3名学生到伯克利主校区进行暑期交流。在与学生在北大的培养计划不冲突的情况下，BCCP也鼓励延长交流时间至一个学期。资深的研究人员（博士后或以上）会为学生的学术科研提供指导。根据项目的资金和实际运行情况，BCCP有可能对交流学生的生活及签证进行部分或全部费用补助。

   科研项目大致分为以下两类。学生需在申请时注明感兴趣的方向（可以多选）。BCCP 会根据学生和项目运行的需求进行调整。

   **数据科学方向**

   研究统计学，机器学习和数据挖掘的技术以及它们在物理学（包括宇宙学）中的应用。BCCP会提供相应的学术指导。

   **宇宙学方向**

   研究一个宇宙学课题：发展理论模型，进行数据分析，或者编写模拟程序。
   学生需在交流项目结束时提交一份研究进展报告或将结果发表为学术文章。如果是后者，学生在项目结束后需要参与审稿过程，包括修改文章，重新提交等。此过程历时可长达一年。

   **申请要求**

   - 在校大二及大三物理或天文专业学生。
   - 英语交流流利
   - 成绩优异；如已有研究经验为佳
   - 基本计算机能力：了解数据结构与算法；命令行环境和远程连接；Python数据分析。如已有超级计算和图形处理器的编程经验为佳。
   - 基本的物理学知识：理论力学；热力学；现代物理学；如已有宇宙学方面的知识为佳。

   **申请资料**

   - 个人自述：一页以内个人自述。内容可以是总结一下学习工作的经验，展望一下自己未来的计划。请独立完成。
   - 简历，成绩单，和年级排名。
   - 一封导师推荐信；需来自有经验的科研或着学术导师。（请不要超过三封）

   **申请截止时间**

   2019年2月1日

   咨询或请联系冯雨 yfeng1@berkeley.edu （中英文） 或者 Uros Seljak useljak@berkeley.edu （英文）

   申请材料请递交到 yfeng1@berkeley.edu
