Three-dimensional maps of the large scale structure as traced by galaxies are available from the `Sloan Digital Sky Survey III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey <https://www.sdss3.org/surveys/boss.php>`__ project.  A `final data release (DR12) <http://www.sdss.org/dr12/data_access/>`__ is available and contains all spectra taken by the survey.
