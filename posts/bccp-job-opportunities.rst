**Postdoctoral Fellow positions**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP) at the University of
California, Berkeley, invites applications for the BCCP Postdoctoral
Fellowship, starting in the summer or fall of 2015. The BCCP Fellows are
expected to carry out independent research on topics of their choosing
in cosmology. We are especially encouraging applications in the
intersection area between cosmology, fundamental physics and
astrophysics. The position is for three years. In addition to being
considered for the BCCP Fellowship, applicants will also be considered
for grant-supported postdoctoral positions with BCCP members.
Information on the BCCP's current activities and membership may be found
at the BCCP's website: bccp.berkeley.edu. Successful candidates will
have the opportunity to interact and work with the broad spectrum of
researchers in the Berkeley Astronomy and Physics Departments, and at
the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The experimental and
theoretical cosmology programs at Berkeley include supernovae, galaxy
clustering, weak lensing and CMB. Candidates should have obtained their
Ph.D. in physics, astrophysics or a related field before their
appointment start date. The total duration of an individual's
postdoctoral service may not exceed five years, including postdoctoral
service at other institutions. To apply, submit a copy of your
curriculum vitae, bibliography, and statement of research interests
to \ **`https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/apply/JPF00561 <https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/apply/JPF00561>`__** by
December 1, 2014. At least 3 letters of reference should also be
submitted by the same date.    For further inquiries contact BCCP
directors Uros Seljak
at \ `useljak@berkeley.edu <mailto:useljak@berkeley.edu>`__, Oliver Zahn
at \ `**zahn@berkeley.edu** <mailto:zahn@berkeley.edu>`__ and Saul
Perlmutter at \ `saul@lbl.gov <mailto:saul@lbl.gov>`__. For inquiries of
administrative nature, contact Melissa Barclay at mbarclay@berkeley.edu.
All letters will be treated as confidential per University of California
policy and California state law. Please refer potential referees,
including when letters are provided via a third party (i.e., dossier
service or career center), to the UC Berkeley statement of
confidentiality: \ `http://apo.chance.berkeley.edu/evalltr.html <http://apo.chance.berkeley.edu/evalltr.html>`__.
UC Berkeley is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer.
Benefits are included.

**Cosmology Data-Science Fellow positions at all levels from
post-doctoral through more senior scientist available in new “Cosmology
Data Science Initiative” at Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics.**
The Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics (BCCP) at UC Berkeley is
pioneering a new “Cosmology Data-Science Initiative,” with one or more
positions available at all levels from post-doctoral through senior
scientist, depending on experience. The members of this group will
explore a novel approach to Cosmology Data Science (CDS): Each CDS
Fellow will have half their research devoted to a specific cosmology
project of the BCCP, working as a scientist in a research group with all
of the expected goals of project planning, data collection, data
reduction/analysis, publication, and conference-presentation of results.
The other half of each CDS Fellow’s research will examine the
data-science steps needed to accomplish these science goals, and look
for approaches to redesigning these steps and make current and future
science projects progress faster and more reliable. Questions that the
CDS Initiative intends to address include: What are the current data
science steps that are slowing down the scientists and/or distracting
them from their primary science questions? What aspects make it
difficult for a new member of a research team to come up to speed and
begin contributing quickly? Why is it difficult to benefit from software
that was written for a previous project, or by a previous member of the
science team? For the data-science half of the CDS Fellow’s research,
the Fellows will work not just individually, but also together as a CDS
Initiative team, with the goal of finding or inventing common solutions
to the problems and opportunities that they identify. The CDS team will
also meet regularly with Data Science Fellows in other fields at UC
Berkeley. The CDS Fellows will have the opportunity to interact and work
with the broad spectrum of cosmology researchers in the Berkeley
Astronomy and Physics Departments, and at the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory (LBNL). The experimental and observational cosmology programs
at Berkeley include supernovae, galaxy clustering (including baryonic
acoustic oscillations), weak lensing and cosmic microwave background, in
addition to a broad theoretical cosmology research program. Information
on the BCCP's current activities and membership may be found at the
BCCP's website: bccp.berkeley.edu. The Fellows will also find a rich
data-science environment at UC Berkeley and LBNL, with world- expert
researchers in both computer science and domain science aspects of this
emerging field. We plan to make one or more new Cosmology Data-Science
Initiative Fellow appointments, in addition to the existing three. The
positions are for two years initially with the possibility of extension
of up to three additional years, subject to a performance review.
Further extensions beyond this may be possible subject to availability
of funds. Salaries for these full-time positions will be commensurate
with experience. Basic qualifications: Candidate must have completed all
Ph.D. (or equivalent) requirements in physics, astrophysics or a related
field at the time of application (except for the dissertation or
equivalent). Preferred qualifications: We are looking for individuals
with strong scientific research experience, ideally in cosmology, as
well as strong interest and experience in data science approaches.
Additional qualifications: Must have received PhD or equivalent by start
of appointment. To apply, submit a copy of your curriculum vitae,
bibliography, and statement of cosmology and data science research
interests to:
**`https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/apply/JPF00562.  <https://aprecruit.berkeley.edu/apply/JPF00562.%C2%A0>`__**
To receive full consideration please send the material by December 1,
2014, but later applications may also be considered until all the
positions are filled.  At least 3 letters of reference should also be
submitted by the same date.  For further inquiries, contact BCCP
directors Uros Seljak
at \ `**useljak@berkeley.edu** <mailto:useljak@berkeley.edu>`__, Oliver
Zahn at \ `**zahn@berkeley.edu** <mailto:zahn@berkeley.edu>`__ and Saul
Perlmutter at \ `**saul@lbl.gov** <mailto:saul@lbl.gov>`__. For
inquiries of an administrative nature, contact Melissa Barclay at
mbarclay@berkeley.edu. Salary and Benefits: Salary will be commensurate
with experience. For information on UC Postdoc benefits, please visit:
