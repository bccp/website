Moore Foundation](http://www.moore.org/newsitem.aspx?id=4812) to the
University of California at Berkeley, through the Berkeley Center for
Cosmological Physics (BCCP), will fund the development of revolutionary
technologies for BigBOSS, a project now in the proposal stage designed to
study dark energy with unprecedented precision. BigBOSS is based at the U.S.
Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).
“BigBOSS is the next big thing in cosmology,” says Uroš Seljak, Director of
the BCCP, who is a professor of physics and astronomy at UC Berkeley and a
member of Berkeley Lab’s Physics Division. “It would map millions and millions
of galaxies, allowing us to measure dark energy to high precision – and would
yield other important scientific results as well, including determining
neutrino mass and the number of neutrino families.” Dark energy is the unknown
something that appears to account for almost three-quarters of the mass-energy
of the universe and is the cause of its accelerating expansion. The discovery
of the accelerating universe, announced in 1998 by two teams, resulted in the
2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, divided between Berkeley Lab and UC Berkeley
astrophysicist Saul Perlmutter, leader of the Supernova Cosmology Project, and
Brian Schmidt and Adam Riess of the competing High‑z Supernova Search team.
“After we won the Nobel Prize, the question we all heard most was, ‘Now that
you’ve discovered dark energy, what comes next?’” says Perlmutter, who is the
Executive Director of the BCCP as well as principal investigator for the Moore
Foundation’s BigBOSS grant. “The answer is pretty clear: we have to find out
what dark energy is. There’s no end of theories. To know which are possible,
what we need most is the kind of accurate observational evidence that only
BigBOSS and other advanced experiments can give us.”
