In this video, Berkeley Lab astrophysicists and Nobel laureates, George Smoot
and Saul Perlmutter -- joined by Berkeley Lab physicist Eric Linder and UC
anthropologist Gerardo Aldana -- explore the cultural and scientific
connections between Mayan astronomers and modern cosmologists as they look to
the skies for answers to how the universe evolved, how it might end, and our
place in it. The fundamental human curiosity about our origins and fate, a
quest that persists across time and cultures, has been enriched by recent
discoveries about dark energy, the Big Bang, and the accelerating universe.
New knowledge has only increased our sense of wonder about the cosmos and
deepened our appreciation for what the Mayans achieved using only the naked
eye.
